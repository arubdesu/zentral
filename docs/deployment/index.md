# Zentral deployment

Zentral relies on many components (datatase, event queues, web server, SCEP server, …). It could be challenging to maintain or deploy on your own. This is why we recommend [requesting a test environment](https://www.zentral.com/contact/) in our SaaS.

For the more adventurous, we maintain [Docker with docker-compose](./docker-compose) deployments. They can be used to evaluate Zentral and for simple setups. We also use them internally to work on Zentral.
